// A sparse matrix is a matrix in which most of the elements are zero. (typically more than 50%)

/*
    Properties
    1. Storage Efficiency: Sparse matrices can be represented more efficiently using specialized data structures that store only non-zero elements.
    2. Operations: Many matrix operations can be optimized when working with sparse matrices, allowing for faster computations by ignoring zero elements.
